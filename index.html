      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>

        To be successful IT graduates need to understand the use of industry tools and practices, the ways these tools
        work and connect together, and the underlying professional, ethical, and teamwork knowledge and skills needed to
        put these into practice in a professional manner. This unit introduces students to IT workflows, agile project
        management, dev-ops pipelines, version control, and the ways these tools fit together in modern companies. The
        use of these technologies is underpinned by the behaviours, teamwork, and ethical considerations needed to
        engage in working in IT in a professional manner. The unit will tackle the big issues facing IT industry with a
        focus on gender equity and diversity, helping ensure our future IT leaders are well placed to address this and
        other challenging issues.
